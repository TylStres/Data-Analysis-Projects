# Data-Analysis-Projects
 Just a place for me to store some of my Data Analysis Projects That I am working on.
 These projects are primarily being conducted with Kaggle datasets. Each project will have its own folder. 
 Each folders structure will be:
    -Project name-
        -Original Dataset zip-
        -Extracted Dataset used in the project-
        -Project related files: .py, .ipynb, .png (For any graphs that I save)

My first project "Movie was done in a standard .py file. This served as a good starting point but I found it was poorly implemented as it required me to print every graph and save them in order to make them visible in GitHub. Moving forward I will be doing projects in the Jupyter Notebooks. This makes them far more readable in GitHub themselves. Additionally, I will be including links to the original notebooks if there are any. My plan is to follow along with a few. Then start making some of my own. I am currently just following along with others to see what some of the norms are when creating portfolios and projects. Any work that is entirely my own will be disclosed in the top Markdown of each file.
